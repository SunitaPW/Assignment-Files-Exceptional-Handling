        "Multiple core/processors are there, and each process has it's own memory space and resources (data/variable/executable program) which are isolated from other process.\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiprocessing runs truly parallel on multiple CPU coress/processor. This dosen't have GIL(Global Interpreter lock)\n",
        "\n",
        "Use Case for Multiprocessing :- It is suitable for tasks that are independent and which can run isolation,\n",

        "\n",
        "## Why Multiprocessing is Used in Python Programs is explained below :-\n",
        "\n",
        "- 1) By Enhancing Performance for CPU-bound Tasks through parallel execution and scalability :-\n",
        "\n",
        "- - Parallel Execution: Multiprocessing enables the execution of multiple CPU-bound tasks in parallel. Each process can run on a different CPU core, leading to improved performance for tasks that involve heavy computation, such as numerical simulations, data processing, and machine learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "- - Scalability: As the number of CPU cores increases, multiprocessing can scale to utilize additional cores, enhancing the performance of compute-intensive applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "- 2) Bypassing the (GIL):- GIL Limitation: Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple native threads from executing Python bytecodes simultaneously. This can be a bottleneck for CPU-bound tasks, as it restricts the execution of threads to one at a time within a single process.\n",
        "\n",
        "- 3) Efficient Resource Management by resource utilization and task management :-\n",
        "\n",
        "- - Resource Utilization: Multiprocessing allows the program to efficiently use system resources by running tasks in parallel, thereby improving the overall efficiency and throughput of the application.\n",
        "\n",
        "- - Task Management: Multiprocessing frameworks often provide mechanisms for managing and distributing tasks among processes, ensuring that system resources are used optimally.\n",
        "\n",
        "- 4) Simplified Parallel Task Execution :- Python's multiprocessing module provides a simple and high-level interface for creating and managing multiple processes. It includes features like process pools, queues, and pipes to facilitate parallel execution and inter-process communication."

        "\n",
        "- - \"Lock\" ---> **threading.Lock** :- A basic synchronization primitive that prevents multiple threads from executing a critical section of code simultaneously. It ensures that only one thread can acquire the lock at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "- - \"Rlock\" / (Reentrant Locks) ---> **threading.RLock** :- Similar to Lock, but allows a thread to acquire the same lock multiple times. Useful when the same thread needs to enter the critical section multiple times.\n",
        "\n",
        "- - \"Condition Variables\" ---> **threading.Condition** :- Allows threads to wait until a certain condition is met. Useful for more complex thread coordination.\n",
        "\n",
        "- - \"Event Objects\" ---> **threading.Event** :- Used for simple signaling between threads. One thread can set the event to signal other threads.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2) Multiprocessing :- We can use \"Lock\", \"Queue\", \"Pipe\", and \"Manager\" from the multiprocessing module for process synchronization and communication. These are explained below :-\n",
        "\n",
        "- - \"Locks\" ---> **multiprocessing.Lock** :- Similar to threading.Lock, but designed for use with processes. It prevents multiple processes from entering a critical section simultaneously.\n",
        "\n",
        "- - \"Queues\" ---> **multiprocessing.Queue** :- A process-safe queue for inter-process communication. It allows processes to safely exchange data.\n",
        "\n",
        "- - \"Pipes\" ---> **multiprocessing.Pipe** :- Provides a two-way communication channel between processes. One end of the pipe is used for sending data, while the other end is used for receiving data.\n",
        "\n",
        "- - \"Managers\" ---> **multiprocessing.Manager** :- Provides a way to create shared objects (like lists, dictionaries, etc.) that can be safely used by multiple processes.\n",

        "## It crucial to handle exceptions in concurrent programs and the techniques available for doing so because due to the inherent complexities of managing multiple threads or processes running simultaneously.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Importance of Exception Handling in Concurrent Programs :-\n",
        "\n",
        "- Error Isolation: In concurrent programs, exceptions in one thread or process can affect others if not handled properly. Proper exception handling ensures that one thread's failure doesn't cause the entire program to crash.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Resource Management: Concurrent programs often involve shared resources (e.g., files, network connections). If exceptions are not handled correctly, it can lead to resource leaks or inconsistent states, affecting the stability and performance of the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Debugging and Maintenance: Exception handling improves the ability to diagnose and fix issues. Without it, it may be challenging to pinpoint the cause of a failure in a multithreaded or multiprocess environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "- User Experience: For applications with a user interface or external dependencies, unhandled exceptions can lead to crashes or unresponsiveness, negatively impacting the user experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## There are 5 Techniques for Handling Exceptions in Concurrent Programs explained below :-\n",
        "\n",
        "- 1) Try-Except Blocks ----> Thread-Level Handling :- Use try-except blocks within each thread to catch exceptions specific to that thread's execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "- 2) Exception Propagation ----> Thread-Level Exception Propagation :- Capture exceptions within threads and propagate them back to the main thread if needed. This can be done by using a queue to send exceptions from the worker thread to the main thread.\n",
        "\n",
        "- 3) Using concurrent.futures ----> Futures and Exception Handling :- The concurrent.futures module provides a higher-level interface for managing threads or processes. Futures allow you to handle exceptions more gracefully using the result() method, which can re-raise exceptions from the worker thread.\n",
        "\n",
        "- 4) Process-Level Handling ----> Using multiprocessing :- For processes, exception handling can be done within each process similarly to threads. You can use queues or other inter-process communication methods to report exceptions to the main process.\n",
        "\n",
        "- 5) Synchronization and Coordination ----> Locks and Synchronization :- When handling exceptions, ensure that resources are properly synchronized. Use locks or other synchronization primitives to avoid race conditions or data corruption."
